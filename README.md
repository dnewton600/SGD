# SGD
This repository contains simulations and empirical experiments of SGD.

'app.R' is an R Shiny app that visualizes the descent of a few different kinds of SGD algorithms. (basic fixed-step, basic diminishing-step, momentum, and ADAM). I created this for a presentation in the Stochastic Optimization seminar at Purdue.
