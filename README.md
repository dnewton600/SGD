# SGD
This repository contains an app for simulating variations of SGD and observing the performance.

'app.R' is an R Shiny app that visualizes the descent of a few different kinds of SGD algorithms (Basic fixed-step, basic diminishing-step, momentum, and ADAM). I created this for a presentation in the Stochastic Optimization seminar at Purdue.
